1: What is the difference between composition and inheritance? Which paradigm is preferred in React?  Write a brief note about it in your own words.
answer:
		Composition and inheritance are the approaches to use multiple components together in React js . 
		This helps in code reuse. 
		React recommend using composition instead of inheritance as much as possible and inheritance should be used in very specific cases only.

		Differences:

		composition:

		1:Follows has-a relationship                                 
		2:Composition allows code-reuse.	  
        3:In composition, you will no need to extend classes	
        4:In composition, you will no need to Mixin.	
        5:The composition is more flexible.	

        
        inheritence:

        1:Follows is-a relationship
        2:Inheritance does not allow code-reuse.
        3.In inheritance, you will need to extend classes.
        4.In inheritance, Mixin plays a major role.
        5.Inheritance is less flexible compared to composition.

2: In what cases do we need to 'lift the state up'?
answer:
		If the data in “parent and children components” or in “cousin components” is Not in Sync

3: What is a handler function. When do we use it?
answer:
		A handler function which is specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks
		 handler enables you to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element, such as a button, in your app.
   

    Event handlers determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired. 
    This could be a button click or a change in a text input.
    
    Synthetic events
     It has the same interface as the browser’s native event

The React onClick event handler enables us to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element,
such as a button, in our app.
